# Spring Integration in Action

This project contains the code examples from the book "Spring Integration in Action" (Manning, 2012).

To build and run tests, change into the 'siia-examples' directory and execute: mvn test

To explore the code, we recommend importing the projects (located in the sub-directories) into an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ Idea.
